    <h4>MUSICAL TIME CAPSULE</h4>

    <h2>
    It’s Time To Unlock Your Playlist In a Bottle From 2023 (and Make a New One for Next Year)
    </h2>

    <p>JANUARY 4, 2024</p>

    <p>
    Quick pulse check: What’s your mood, your inspiration, and your mindset as you kick off <br> 
    2024? Does it match your feelings from a year ago? 
    <br>
    <br>
    
    Last year we introduced “Playlist in a Bottle,” giving listeners a chance to capture the songs <br>
     that resonated with them at that moment in time and seal it away for one year. The <br> 
     interactive in-app experience is the perfect time capsule to remember and reflect on the <br> 
     music you loved, and how your taste may have evolved over the past 365 days. If you’re one <br>
      of the millions of Spotify listeners who participated then, today is the day to unlock your <br>
       “Playlist in a Bottle” from last year. </p>

       <h2>
       Here’s how
       </h2>

       <p>
       Visit spotify.com/playlistinabottle on your mobile device. <br>

    Choose “Claim Your Playlist” to see which songs were sealed in your musical time capsule. <br>

    Save and listen to your complete 2023 Playlist in a Bottle. You only have until January 31!
    <br>
    <br>

    <span>
    Now it’s time to create a new Playlist in a Bottle to open in 2025. This experience is open to <br>
     all Spotify listeners—whether you made one last year or this is your first time checking out <br>
      the experience. This time around, you’ll answer questions like “what song brings out my  <br>
      alter-ego” and “what song describes my relationship status” to curate your playlist. You can <br>
      also select where you want to store your playlist from a series of objects, and write a note to <br>
      your future self.</span>
